An enhanced replacement for Omarchy's standard `SUPER + K` window that makes it easy for anyone to learn, practice, and master system keybindings.

Instead of displaying a static text cheatsheet, it actively suggests shortcut combinations based on **whatever you currently have open on your computer**, helping you navigate faster and build real keyboard muscle memory.

## 🚀 Quick Install

Install and enable the plugin with a single command:

* `nav-guide-keybindings.json`: Cached system keybinding registry.
