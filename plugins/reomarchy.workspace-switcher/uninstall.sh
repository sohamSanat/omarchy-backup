#!/bin/bash -p
# -p makes bash ignore BASH_ENV, ENV, SHELLOPTS and inherited shell functions.
# PATH, CDPATH and IFS are replaced before anything is looked up, and this
# script runs no external command until it has done so, so nothing here is
# resolved through a caller-controlled search path.
#
# Scope: the dynamic loader acts before the first line of this script, so
# LD_PRELOAD and friends cannot be neutralized from inside the process they
# affect. Anyone who can set them in your environment can already run code as
# you; see the README.

# Dropping the loader variables here cannot unmap what is already loaded into
# this shell, but it does keep them out of every process the script starts,
# including /usr/bin/env itself, whose own environment `env -i` cannot change.
