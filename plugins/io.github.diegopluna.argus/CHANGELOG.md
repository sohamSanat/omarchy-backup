# Changelog

All notable changes to Argus are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.2.2] — 2026-08-30

### Fixed
- **The recommended MangoHud setup was dangerous and is now scoped.**
  The docs and GAME tab previously suggested session-global
  `MANGOHUD=1`, which loads the Vulkan layer into every Vulkan process
  — including the Omarchy shell, where libMangoHud segfaulted inside
  quickshell's `vkCreateDevice` and crash-looped the whole desktop.
  The corrected model: session-global env carries only the config path
  plus a hard-off (`MANGOHUD=0` — the loader's enable check requires
  exactly "1", verified empirically — and `MANGOHUD_CONFIGFILE=...`,
  via `hl.env` in hyprland.lua; the old `env =` conf syntax does
  nothing on current Omarchy and fails silently); activation is
  strictly per game (`MANGOHUD=1 %command%` in Steam launch options). The GAME tab's status
  line and setup instructions teach the scoped model, and its
  readiness check now tracks the config path.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-08-29

### Fixed
- Renamed `screenshots/tab-setup.png` to `tab-settings.png`. The
  marketplace's security baseline force-scans any file whose name
  contains "setup" as a potential install script, and a binary asset
  with such a name fails the scan closed — this one screenshot was the
  entire cause of the `security-baseline-scan-limit` verification
  failures. Diagnosed by running the marketplace's own scanner against
  the release commit.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-08-29

### Added
- **GAME tab: the in-game HUD's control room.** Argus is now a GUI for
  MangoHud — pick which metrics the overlay shows (FPS, frametime
  graph, CPU/GPU load/temp/power/clocks, VRAM, RAM, engine/Wine,
  per-core loads…), give CPU and GPU custom labels, set position, font
  size, background opacity, compact mode, start-hidden, and the toggle
  hotkey. With "Match Omarchy theme colors" on, the in-game overlay
  follows the shell theme — re-theming the desktop restyles the HUD in
  a running game. Every change writes Argus's own managed config
  (`~/.local/state/argus/mangohud.conf`; the user's MangoHud.conf is
  never touched) and fires `mangohudctl reload-cfg`, so edits apply
  live mid-game. The tab detects whether MangoHud is installed and
  whether the global-injection env (`MANGOHUD=1` +
  `MANGOHUD_CONFIGFILE`) is active, and shows the exact one-time setup
  lines when it isn't; disabling the master toggle renders a config
  that hides the HUD, so that too takes effect live.
- **Test window**: a button in the GAME tab spawns a looping Vulkan
  test pattern (mpv) with the HUD injected — tweak any knob and watch
  the overlay restyle live, no game required. One instance at a time;
  close the window when done.
- Richer HUD customization: FPS limit (off/30/60/90/120/144/165/240),
  FPS color thresholds (red-below / green-above), horizontal layout,
  round corners, table columns, and X/Y offsets — plus four more metric
  rows (throttling status, FPS histogram, clock, battery).
- The tab strip tightened its spacing so all twelve tabs keep to one
  row.
- The marketplace preview became a product banner — wordmark, tagline,
  feature chips, and layered live screenshots — instead of a raw panel
  capture. Its SVG source lives in `screenshots/banner.svg` for future
  edits; the manifest's widget description caught up with the panel's
  current feature set.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-08-29

### Changed
- Profiling found the sampler's real cost: not the Super I/O chip the
  docs blamed (13 sensors in 3ms), but a single NVMe drive taking ~75ms
  to answer its temperature — an admin command that also keeps the
  drive awake. Temperatures and fans now sample every third tick, with
  the last readings replayed between; a fast tick is ~6ms of wall time
  instead of ~135ms (measured), and panel opens or manual refreshes
  always sample everything.
- The static half of the sample (models, GPU names, topology) is parsed
  once at startup instead of being re-parsed inside every tick, and
  static-derived state no longer reassigns per tick — the CPU core grid
  and friends stop rebuilding for data that cannot change.
- Sparklines stopped churning the scene graph: a fixed-count Repeater
  updates 60 bars in place instead of destroying and recreating them on
  every tick (the HOME tab alone was cycling ~400 items every 2s).
  Tab, tile, and alert row models now hang off stable booleans, so
  per-tick data arrays no longer rebuild their delegates.
- The full process table ships only while the PROC tab is watched
  (fetched immediately on switching to it); other panel ticks carry the
  CPU-sorted top 60. Interface identity (IP/SSID) refreshes every fifth
  panel tick instead of every tick.
- Net effect, measured on the reference machine: idle sampling cost
  dropped from ~135ms to ~40ms average wall per tick, and the polled
  NVMe gets to sleep between full ticks.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-08-29

### Security
- Every Text rendering dynamic strings is pinned to
  `textFormat: Text.PlainText` — the 1.0.0 additions (alert rows, home
  tiles, tab strip, topology captions, process cells, sensor-alert
  limits) had left some on Qt's default AutoText, and device/sensor
  strings originate in sysfs model strings a USB device chooses.
  Flagged by the marketplace's automated security baseline; the audit
  now covers all 22 previously unpinned dynamic Text items.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-29

### Added
- **The flight recorder.** The 1-hour peak ring gained a sibling: a
  24-hour ring (one 24-minute peak per bar), and both — plus the alert
  log — persist to `~/.local/state/argus/history.json` once a minute
  (and on every fired alert), reloading when the shell starts with
  downtime rendered as empty slots. "Was the machine hot overnight?"
  survives restarts, reboots, and crashes. Chart captions now cycle
  2m → 1h → 24h; `span 24h` works over IPC.
- **Alert context snapshots.** Every logged alert records what the
  system looked like the moment it fired — CPU/RAM/temperature/GPU
  values and the busiest processes. Click an alert in the ALERTS tab to
  expand it. The log grew to twenty entries and persists with the
  recorder.
- **PWR tab**: measured power draw per source — CPU package and
  friends via RAPL energy counters (wrap-safe watts from µJ deltas),
  every GPU, battery discharge — plus session energy totals in Wh.
  CPU-package watts, GPU watts, and CPU temperature ride the flight
  recorder too: their charts (PWR draw charts, the CPU tab's
  temperature chart) zoom to 1h and 24h and survive restarts, so
  "did power or thermals spike overnight" is answerable in watts and
  degrees, not just usage. Pre-1.0 history files load with the new
  series empty.
  Kernels that keep RAPL root-only (the default since the PLATYPUS
  mitigation) get an honest hint and a documented one-line udev unlock
  instead of silence; Argus never asks for privileges itself.
- The PROC tab became a real process table: the sampler ships the full
  table (with user and thread count) instead of two top-10 lists, and
  the panel filters it live (`/` focuses the field; name, user, or pid),
  sorts by any column (click headers; direction flips on re-click),
  walks rows with j/k, expands a row (click or Enter) to the full
  command line, owner, and thread count, and offers Terminate and
  Kill −9 — both behind the usual confirmation, with `x` as the
  keyboard shortcut for Terminate on the cursor row.
- The CPU tab's thread grid is laid out like the silicon: SMT siblings
  fuse into one core cell, cores group under their L3 domain (CCDs on
  multi-die parts, with per-CCD live clocks), and hybrid chips draw
  efficiency cores shorter (rated-ceiling spread, no hardcoded models).
  Machines without exposed topology keep the flat grid.
- The MEM tab shows where the memory actually is — an in use / cache /
  free split bar with free(1)'s accounting and a note that cache is
  reclaimable — plus a dirty-pages row, and the swap row names its
  backing ("zram (compressed RAM)", "zram + disk").
- NET interfaces carry their identity: kind icon (Wi-Fi / Ethernet /
  virtual), the Wi-Fi SSID, and the IPv4 address, from a panel-only
  sample (`ip`, `iw` when present).

- **HOME tab**: the panel opens on a configurable overview — a grid of
  glance tiles (CPU, memory, GPU, network, disk I/O, disk, battery),
  each with its live value, a subline, and a sparkline or meter that
  follows the 2m/1h/24h span. Click a tile to open its tab; pick tiles
  in the BAR tab. The last fired alert shows beneath, linking to
  ALERTS.
- The ALERTS tab lists the per-sensor alerts armed from the TEMP tab —
  with live readings, thresholds, and one-click removal — so it is the
  single complete view of everything armed.
- PWR tab draw charts: CPU-package and GPU power sparklines with
  session peaks.
- The BAR tab became **SETUP** — the one place for all panel
  configuration: bar metrics, Home tiles, temperature unit (°C/°F,
  display-only; Fahrenheit readings carry an explicit °F suffix —
  measurement, storage, and thresholds stay Celsius), and the refresh
  interval. `tab BAR` over IPC still works as an alias.
- Integrated GPUs get plain names — die codenames ("Phoenix1", "Granite
  Ridge", "Raptor Lake-P") mean nothing to most people: AMD APUs
  display as "AMD Integrated Graphics", and Intel iGPUs whose lspci
  string carries no product name display as "Intel Integrated
  Graphics" (real names like "UHD Graphics 770" or "Arc A770" pass
  through).
- Reopening the panel lands on the tab you left (session-scoped); an
  urgent metric still overrides and lands on its tab.
- "Open log in nvim" beside the alert log: the flight recorder's raw
  file, pretty-printed (jq) and read-only, in a terminal via
  omarchy-launch-or-focus-tui — rings, alerts, and context snapshots
  in full.
- The scroll indicator got its own gutter — it no longer overlaps
  toggles and steppers at the panel's right edge.

### Changed
- The tab selector became a one-row underline strip: plain text tabs
  with an accent underline on the active one, hover brightening, and
  wheel-scroll cycling — eleven tabs in a single calm row where the old
  bordered chips needed two, handing ~45px back to content.
- `tests/make-fixture.sh` scrubs the new sections too: the full process
  table (usernames, command lines) and NETINFO (IP addresses, SSID) are
  dropped from contributed fixtures.
- The README leads with what makes Argus different (flight recorder,
  self-explaining alerts, honesty), ships Hyprland keybind recipes, and
  every screenshot is refreshed to the 1.0 UI.
- Intel GPU *usage* stays honestly unavailable: reading it needs
  `intel_gpu_top` with CAP_PERFMON, and Argus doesn't ask for
  privileges. Deliberately deferred until an Intel fixture and a tested
  unprivileged path exist.

## [0.9.1] — 2026-08-29

### Fixed
- GPUs whose lspci name carries only a vendor bracket ("Advanced Micro
  Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Phoenix1") displayed as "AMD/ATI"; the vendor
  tag is now stripped so the chip name shows.
- The APU memory rows now state both halves of the pool with their used
  figures — "VRAM (reserved carve-out) 483 MB of 512 MB" and "GTT
  (shared system RAM) 587 MB of 16 GB" — instead of totals only, so the
  pooled meter reconciles against what radeontop and sysfs report. The
  meter itself still covers the pool: a near-full carve-out is normal on
  an APU (the driver spills to GTT transparently), and only pool
  pressure is real memory pressure.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-08-29

### Changed
- **Alerts are now per-metric opt-in and off by default**, configured in
  a new ALERTS panel tab listing every alert — CPU usage, CPU
  temperature, RAM, GPU usage/temperature, VRAM, disk usage, drive
  temperature, battery low, drive health — each with its own toggle and
  an inline −/+ threshold stepper, above the fired-alert log (which
  moved there from the BAR tab). The enabled set persists to shell.json
  as `alertsOn` (empty by default), so a fresh install never notifies
  until the user asks it to. Thresholds still color bar segments and
  panel rows urgent whether or not the alert is on — the toggle gates
  notifications only. Rows for hardware the machine lacks (GPU, battery,
  drive sensors) don't appear.
- An AMD iGPU's memory now reports its real pool — BIOS carve-out plus
  GTT (shared system RAM) — instead of the carve-out alone, which
  understated an APU's ceiling by an order of magnitude (512 MB where
  ~16 GB is allocatable). Applies to the GPU tab meter (with the
  reserved + GTT split shown underneath), the bar's VRAM metric, and the
  VRAM alert. APUs are detected by the kernel exposing `mem_busy_percent`
  only for dedicated VRAM; primary-GPU ranking deliberately stays on
  dedicated VRAM so an iGPU's RAM-sized GTT never outranks a real dGPU.
- The previously hardcoded alert values became settings: battery low
  (`urgentBatPct`, default 15%) and the drive-health wear alarm
  (`urgentWearPct`, default 90%; a critical warning or media errors
  still trip it at any wear level). GPU usage and VRAM split off from
  the CPU/RAM thresholds they shared (`urgentGpuPct`, `urgentVramPct`);
  the old shared values keep covering them until their own are set.
- Threshold editing moved out of the plugin settings form and into the
  ALERTS tab; the form keeps the master alerts switch and the alert
  hook. Previously stored `urgent*` values are still honored.
- Each alert row shows the live reading it watches ("now 43% · ≥ 90%"),
  so thresholds are set against reality instead of blind; an armed
  alert's threshold renders in the accent color, and the rows group
  under USAGE / TEMPERATURE / HEALTH headers.
- The tab selector wraps instead of overflowing the panel — ten tabs no
  longer fit one row — and hairline separators divide the GPU, DISK,
  and BAT tabs' per-device blocks, which previously ran together.
- The GPU tab lists the primary card first — the card whose stats the
  bar follows shouldn't hide below an idle iGPU.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-08-21

### Security
- Every Text rendering system-controlled strings (process command lines,
  sensor and device names, drive models, alert log entries) is pinned to
  `textFormat: Text.PlainText` — Qt's default AutoText can interpret
  such strings as StyledText markup, and process argv is
  attacker-influenceable. The kill-confirmation dialog's process name is
  additionally stripped of markup-significant characters, since it flows
  into a shell component the plugin cannot pin.

### Changed
- Refreshed every screenshot and the Okomart `preview.png` to the 0.8.0
  UI (watch row, grouped TEMP, per-process GPU, flat BAR tab), and
  reorganized the README: alert behavior — firing rules, attribution,
  per-sensor thresholds, the hook — now lives in one Alerts section, and
  sampling cost sits with the sampling internals.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-08-21

### Changed
- The sampler's CPU cost dropped ~8× (≈81ms → ≈10ms per tick): the
  per-value `cat` calls in the sensor/GPU/battery loops — a fork each,
  ~95% of the sampler's CPU — became zero-fork bash builtin reads, and
  the per-chip `sed` trims became parameter expansion. Output is
  byte-for-byte structurally identical. Most remaining wall time is the
  hwmon sensor bus itself (Super I/O chips take milliseconds per reading
  in the kernel), which no sampler can skip.
- The panel hero now carries the eye of Argus (blinking, same as the
  bar placeholder) instead of a generic CPU glyph, and its meta line
  keeps only the 1-minute load — the full triple lives in the CPU tab.
- TEMP tab groups sensors by physical device — one header per device,
  just the sensor label per row — instead of repeating "Motherboard ·
  nct6799 · …" on every line. A group whose sensors are all hidden hides
  its header too.
- Bar segment values are no-break-space padded to a stable width, so
  "9%" → "10%" no longer shifts every neighboring bar widget.
- Sparklines draw a solid baseline and idle samples render nothing —
  no more dashed row of minimum-height stubs when a series is quiet;
  the per-thread grid likewise leaves idle cells empty.
- Rate sparklines (NET, DISK I/O) scale to the session peak and mark it
  with a faint ceiling line, so the y-axis stays put instead of
  rescaling every time a spike scrolls out of the window.
- BAR tab rows are flat (label + switch) instead of bordered cards, with
  a fixed icon column; network and battery — whose bar segments compose
  their own glyphs — get static list icons so no row is iconless.
- Tab labels underline their first letter, advertising the letter-jump
  hotkey; NET rows use the same "·" separator style as DISK.

### Added
- The watch row: a quiet strip of vitals (CPU, RAM, CPU/GPU temperature,
  disk, battery) under the host name, visible on every tab — Argus never
  goes blind to the rest of the system while you read one tab. A vital
  turns urgent with its metric, the current tab's vital reads in the
  foreground color, and clicking one jumps to the tab that explains it.
- Alert hook: an `alertCommand` setting runs a shell command on every
  fired alert with `ARGUS_ALERT_KEY`/`TEXT`/`CRITICAL`/`AT` in the
  environment — one setting turns alerts into automation (ntfy, logs,
  webhooks). Drive-health alerts flow through the same path.
- Self-accounting: the BAR tab shows what sampling actually costs (wall
  clock per tick, measured), also exposed as `samplerMs` in the
  `metrics` IPC snapshot.
- Fixture corpus: `tests/fixtures/` holds scrubbed `sample.sh` captures
  from real machines, each fully re-parsed and rendered through every
  derived-value path on every CI run. `tests/make-fixture.sh` generates
  a contributable (hostname- and process-scrubbed) capture; seeded with
  this Ryzen 9700X + Radeon 9070 box.
- Per-process GPU usage: each GPU's panel section lists its busiest
  processes with usage percent and VRAM, from DRM fdinfo usage stats
  (amdgpu, i915/xe, nouveau — one ~15ms gawk pass, panel-only; the
  proprietary NVIDIA driver exposes no fdinfo stats and lists nothing).
- Drive health: the DISK tab shows each drive's wear, power-on time, and
  status from SMART via udisks2's D-Bus API — the one SMART source that
  needs no root. A drive reporting a critical warning, ≥90% wear, or
  media errors renders urgent and fires one notification per session.
  Sampled at startup and panel open; also in the `metrics` IPC snapshot
  (`driveHealth`).
- Tiered history: behind every sparkline's ~2-minute per-tick ring sits a
  1-hour ring keeping each minute's peak (peaks, not averages — zooming
  out must not erase the spike you're looking for). Click any chart
  caption to flip every chart between the two spans; alert markers move
  with the span, and `span 2m|1h` does the same over IPC.
- Alert attribution: CPU and memory alerts name their likely culprit —
  "CPU usage at 100% (threshold 90%) — chromium 61%". While no panel is
  open, a one-shot `sample.sh ps` fetches the process snapshot at the
  moment the alert fires (with a 2s timeout falling back to an
  unattributed alert).
- Alert markers: the CPU, MEM, and GPU sparklines cap the bar where an
  alert fired with a foreground-colored tick, so the alert log and the
  history tell one story.
- The `metrics` IPC snapshot now includes the alert log (`alerts`).
- A thin scroll indicator on the panel, so long tabs signal the content
  below the fold.
- The hero's refresh glyph spins on every refresh (button, `r`, middle
  click) — refreshing previously gave no visible acknowledgment.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-08-19

### Changed
- PSI rows renamed to "Stall pressure" and now show the 10s/1m/5m windows
  like a load average, with an in-panel note that 0 means nothing had to
  wait — the single 10-second value read as permanently broken-at-zero on
  healthy machines (verified against induced contention: the pipeline
  reports exactly what the kernel does).
- The `metrics` IPC snapshot now includes the PSI values.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-08-19

### Added
- Terminate button on PROC rows: SIGTERM after a confirmation dialog
  (Esc cancels the dialog before it closes the panel).
- Recent-alerts log: the last ten fired alerts with timestamps, shown at
  the bottom of the BAR tab.
- Hide noisy sensors: an eye button per TEMP row persists a
  `hiddenSensors` list; a footer row reveals them again. Hidden sensors'
  thresholds keep alerting.
- Tab hotkeys: `1`–`9` and first-letter jumps (repeats cycle BAR/BAT);
  opening the panel while a metric is urgent lands on the relevant tab.
- `metrics` IPC method returning the current snapshot as JSON, for
  scripting: `omarchy-shell io.github.diegopluna.argus metrics`.
- Sparklines everywhere state their timespan ("last 2m"), and the DISK
  tab gains read/write sparklines.
- One or two things are better discovered than documented.

### Changed
- PROC shows full command lines (argv0 path stripped) instead of the
  kernel's 15-character `comm` truncation.
- Refreshed screenshots and the Okomart `preview.png`, which still showed
  the 0.2.x panel.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-08-19

### Added
- Per-sensor alert thresholds, set from the TEMP tab UI: each sensor row
  has a 󰂚 button opening an inline −/+/off stepper. A sensor over its
  limit renders urgent and fires a critical notification (same 3-tick
  hold and 5-minute cooldown as the built-in alerts). Persisted in
  shell.json as a `sensorThresholds` map keyed by `chip|device|label`,
  stable across reboots and hwmon renumbering. Independent of — and in
  addition to — the CPU/GPU/drive component thresholds.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-08-19

### Added
- Per-component temperature thresholds: `urgentCpuTempC` (85),
  `urgentGpuTempC` (90), and `urgentDriveTempC` (70) replace the single
  `urgentTempC`, which remains honored as a CPU/GPU fallback.
- Drive-temperature alert: watches the hottest NVMe/SATA sensor
  (alert-only, no bar segment; critical urgency).
- Intel GPU support (i915/xe): name, temperature, and power via hwmon;
  usage is marked unavailable rather than shown as zero, since Intel
  exposes no unprivileged busy counter.
- PSI pressure rows (`/proc/pressure`, 10-second averages) in the CPU,
  MEM, and DISK tabs.
- TEMP-tab hint on desktop machines whose motherboard Super I/O sensor
  driver is not loaded, pointing at the README's Fans section.
- Battery charge-limit row (`charge_control_end_threshold`), so a battery
  parked at 80% doesn't look like a bug.
- Kernel version in the CPU tab; battery status in the bar tooltip.

### Changed
- Virtual network interfaces (VPN tunnels, bridges, veth) are excluded
  from the bar's throughput totals — VPN traffic previously counted twice
  — and flagged in the NET tab. All-virtual environments still count
  everything.
- `df` and `lsblk` run under `timeout`: a stale NFS/sshfs mount now costs
  one degraded tick instead of freezing the widget permanently.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-08-19

### Added
- Threshold alerts: a desktop notification when a metric stays past its
  urgent threshold for 3 consecutive ticks (5-minute per-metric cooldown;
  `alerts` setting, default On). Temperatures and battery use critical
  urgency.
- GPU tab: usage sparkline for the primary card, power draw per card
  (amdgpu `power1_average` / nvidia-smi `power.draw`), and session-peak
  temperature.
- Session peaks: CPU temperature, network down/up, and disk I/O peaks
  since shell start, shown in their tabs.
- Fan rows fall back to `fan1`/`fan2`/… names when a chip exposes
  unlabeled headers (Super I/O chips expose several), and the README
  documents loading `nct6775`/`it87` for motherboard fans.
- CI: GitHub Actions runs the model tests on every push.

### Changed
- One sampler now runs for the whole shell instead of one per bar surface
  (the service became a Quickshell singleton) — multi-monitor setups halve
  their sampling work.
- Top processes are sampled only while a panel is open.
- Implausible Super I/O temperature readings (below −40° or above 250°)
  are dropped.
- Refreshed all README screenshots; added the PROC tab.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-08-19

### Added
- Sparkline history in the panel: CPU and RAM usage plus network
  download/upload, over the last 60 samples.
- Urgent-threshold highlighting: bar segments switch to the theme's urgent
  color past configurable thresholds (`urgentCpuPct`, `urgentMemPct`,
  `urgentTempC`, `urgentDiskPct`); load average keys off the thread count
  and battery off ≤15% while discharging.
- Disk I/O rates (read/write per physical disk, from `/proc/diskstats`) in
  the DISK tab and as a selectable `io` bar metric.
- Fan speeds (hwmon `fan*_input`) in the TEMP tab.
- PROC tab: top processes by CPU and by memory.
- Battery support: a BAT tab (charge, status, power draw, health, time
  estimate) and a `bat` bar metric with level/charging glyphs — both appear
  only on machines with a system battery; peripheral batteries (mice,
  keyboards) are filtered out via the sysfs `scope` attribute.
- Bar metrics are reorderable: the stored `show` order is now the display
  order, with move up/down arrows in the BAR tab.

### Changed
- The sampler is split into `static` (hostname, CPU model, disk models,
  GPU names — run once at shell start) and `dynamic` (everything else) —
  `lsblk` and `lspci` no longer run on every tick.
- `nvidia-smi` is never invoked while every NVIDIA card is
  runtime-suspended, so polling cannot keep an Optimus dGPU awake; the
  card is shown as asleep with its last-known identity until it wakes.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-08-18

- Placeholder icon (the eye of Argus, optically centered) when no metric
  renders, so the panel stays reachable from the bar.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-18

- NVIDIA GPU support via nvidia-smi, alongside amdgpu; hybrid systems list
  both, with the bar following the card with the most VRAM.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-18

- Initial release: selectable bar metrics persisted to shell.json and a
  tabbed panel (CPU, MEM, GPU, DISK, NET, TEMP, BAR) with keyboard
  navigation and IPC.
