# Omamail — Spec

A native Gmail client for Omarchy, built as a Quickshell plugin on the official
Gmail REST API. Same technology as Omarchy-Spotify: QML views over plain-JS
logic, running inside the existing `omarchy-shell` process.

## Product shape

**This is a full application window, not a bar popup.** The bar widget exists
only as an unread indicator and a launcher.

Three plugin entry points (`manifest.kinds`):

| Kind | File | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `service` | `Service.qml` | Shared singleton: auth, API, mailbox state, unread polling, new-mail notifications. Lives whether or not the window is open. |
| `bar-widget` | `BarWidget.qml` | Envelope icon + unread badge in the bar. Left click opens the app window. |
| `panel` | `App.qml` | The application window — a single `FloatingWindow`, 980×720 default, 760×520 minimum. Hyprland treats it as an ordinary window. |

## Confirmed decisions

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| List granularity | **One row per message** (`messages.list`), not per thread. Thread aggregation costs an extra `threads.get` round trip per page and doubles the UI states. |
| Body rendering | **Three readings of one message, and reading mode is the default.** Reading mode discards the sender's presentation and rebuilds the message out of what it says — paragraphs, headings, lists, quotes, links, small data tables — in this window's type at a bounded measure; nothing but text, a checked `href`, a checked image source, and bounded numeric image dimensions crosses from the sender's document, so no sender markup reaches Qt at all. Original is the sender's own layout through Qt RichText, sanitised, kept for the receipts and tables whose layout is carrying something. Plain is the text. All three are built from one parse when the body arrives, so choosing between them costs neither a fetch nor a reparse. Remote images are blocked in every one of them until the reader asks; approved visible images are then fetched without redirects and with byte/time limits, and Qt receives only completed `data:` URIs, never pending remote sources or loading placeholders. The fetch still reports the read to the image host. A source aimed at loopback, a private address or a local file is never fetched at all. No browser engine: `QtWebEngineQuick::initialize()` must run before the host process's `QGuiApplication` is constructed, which a plugin loaded later cannot do. |
| Sending | **Included.** Reply, reply-all, forward, and compose, plain-text body with quoted original. Requires the `gmail.send` scope. |
| Bar click | **Opens the app window directly.** Middle click refreshes, right click opens a small menu. |
| Compose surface | **The whole content area of the one window.** Omarchy's panel mechanism gives every extra window its own region, so a reply must not open one. Several accounts share that window; a second mailbox is not a second window. |
| Mailto handler | **This window's compose form.** Install writes a `.desktop` file claiming `x-scheme-handler/mailto` and summons the panel with the URL. Toggle would close a mailbox that is already open. |
| List triage | **Right-click context menu** on any row: reply / reply all / forward, archive / trash / spam, mark read-unread, star, open in browser. |
| Reader actions | **Icons with tooltips**, not labelled buttons — six actions fit where six labels would not, with the destructive one set apart by a rule and the urgent colour. Icons are Canvas paths on one 16px grid, because Qt's SVG renderer smears strokes at this size. |
| Invitations | **Read from the message's own `text/calendar` part, answered as an RFC 5546 reply.** No calendar API and no second OAuth scope: an RSVP is a mail to the organiser carrying `METHOD:REPLY` and this account's `ATTENDEE` line, which is what every calendar server already listens for — so it works identically on IMAP. Gmail withholds the octets of any part the sender named and Google Calendar names both of the two it sends, so the file itself is one more request, made only for a message that has an invitation in it. Times are resolved through the `VTIMEZONE` the sender ships rather than a timezone database; a zone that arrives without one keeps the organiser's wall clock and names it, instead of showing a conversion nothing backs. |
| Unsubscribing | **One click where RFC 8058 promises it will work, and only there.** A `List-Unsubscribe-Post` header plus an `https` URL on a public host is a POST that finishes in the window; an address is a message; anything else opens the sender's page, and the label says so. Whether a URL may be fetched is the same judgement that decides whether a message may load a picture. |
| Sidebar | **An open but narrow icon rail** (148px; 44px collapsed), named by tooltips either way. Collapsing is one click. |
| Loading | **Cache first, then stream.** Every query, the label list, the profile and opened bodies are kept under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/omamail`, keyed by query and bound to the mailbox address. Query summaries share one atomically written file and are capped per query; opened bodies live one file each. Switching mailboxes paints immediately and revalidates behind it. A first-time search filters only cached summaries inside the provider's server-search scope, then treats the server ids as authoritative so a stale preview cannot survive or be persisted. Interactive IMAP search reads only the highest UID first and reports one bounded newest range before taking a UID snapshot for any remaining message-bounded searches on a reused connection. Its settled prefix is final, and one queued metadata read feeds small header batches to the list before the rest of the page. A rotating `Searching server` state inside the query field says that this visible answer is still growing, and disappears only after the listing and its outstanding metadata reads have finished. |
| Setup | **Two steps, one at a time.** Finished steps collapse to a line with a check; the walkthrough hides behind a disclosure. The Publish-app warning stays beside the sign-in button, because it decides whether the session lasts seven days or indefinitely. |

## Authentication

Gmail has no shared public client the way Spotify does — Google issues API
access per Cloud project — so each user creates their own OAuth client once,
guided by an in-app four-step walkthrough.

- Authorization Code + PKCE, loopback redirect `http://127.0.0.1:9481/oauth2callback`
- Listener is a single-shot `socat`; the browser does the rest
- Scopes: `gmail.modify` (read, label, archive, trash — cannot permanently
  delete), `gmail.send` and `calendar.events` (read calendars, write events)
- Refresh token → GNOME Keyring via `secret-tool`, keyed by client and account
- Client id/secret → `~/.config/omamail/credentials.json`, mode 0600.
  Not plugin settings: `shell.json` is world-readable.
- Access token → process memory only

## Keyboard

The keyboard belongs to the application and the context says what a key means
where, the way a TUI scopes its keys. Every binding lives in one table,
`keys/Keymap.js`; the shortcut sheet, the status hints and `docs/KEYS.md` all
render or are checked against it, so no second list is maintained by hand.

`j`/`k` move · `Enter` or `o` open · `u` back to list · `e` archive · `d` trash ·
`s` star · `r`/`a`/`f` reply, reply all, forward · `c` compose · `/` or `Ctrl+K`
search · `Alt+1`…`0` the mailboxes · `Alt+A` switch account · `?` the reference sheet ·
`Esc` back or close.

**See `docs/KEYS.md`** for the model, the contexts, the full table, and the four
Qt behaviours this design is shaped around.

## Constraints

- Every colour comes from the active Omarchy theme. No hard-coded hex outside
  a brand asset.
- All parsing, formatting, and decision logic lives in `.pragma library` JS
  files so it is testable under node without a compositor.
- No dependency beyond what Omarchy already ships: `socat`, `secret-tool`,
  `openssl`, `xdg-open`, `notify-send`.
