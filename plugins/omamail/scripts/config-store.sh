# Neither file it writes is world-readable: a desktop client's secret is only
# "not treated as confidential" by Google, which is not the same as public, and
# the account list names every mailbox on this machine. Plugin settings would
# have been the obvious home for both, but shell.json is world-readable.
#
# One line, read with `read` rather than `cat`: Quickshell's Process.write()
# never closes stdin, so anything waiting for EOF hangs forever.
