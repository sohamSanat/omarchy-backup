// Every mailbox on this machine, and whichever one is on screen.
//
// The window and the bar widget were written against a single mailbox, so this
// keeps that shape: it owns one MailAccount per account and forwards the whole
// surface to the active one. The alternative — teaching every view to say
// `service.current.messages` — spreads the account model across two dozen
// files for no gain.
//
// Every account polls its unread count. Only the active one loads lists and
// bodies: a badge that speaks for one mailbox while you have three is worse
// than no badge, but fetching mail nobody can see is just spent quota.
