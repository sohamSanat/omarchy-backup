// Why hovering a row must not move the keyboard's cursor.
//
// Qt re-reports hover when content moves under a pointer that has not moved.
// The list scrolls to follow the keyboard, so a hover that wrote `cursorId`
// handed it straight back to whatever the mouse was resting on: j moved the
// cursor, the scroll brought a different row under the still pointer, and the
// cursor snapped back. It looked like j and k sticking on a few rows.
//
// This asserts the Qt behaviour rather than the app's wiring, because the
// behaviour is the reason the wiring has to stay apart.
