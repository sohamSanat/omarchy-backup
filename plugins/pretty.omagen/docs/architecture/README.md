## Contributor route

Before changing behavior, identify the owner and read its contract:

- Palette/generation: `backend/internal/imageanalysis`, `palette`,
  `colorspace`, `contrast`, `generation`, and `theme`; see the [palette
  and generation contract](contracts/palette-generation.md).
- Session lifecycle: `session.Service` is the baseline and recovery
  authority; see [lifecycle](lifecycle.md) and the [engine
  contract](contracts/engine.md).
- Live Canvas: `LiveCanvasPanel.qml` emits intent, controllers correlate
  requests, gateways cross the process seam, and backend services mutate the
  desktop; see the [Live Canvas contract](contracts/live-canvas.md).
- QML/Go: views call controllers or gateways, never arbitrary backend
  processes; see the [QML ↔ Go contract](contracts/qml-backend.md).
- Full Bar: `pretty.omagen.bar` and `pretty.omagen` remain separate
  products; see [product boundaries](product-boundaries.md) and the [BarSpec
  contract](contracts/bar-spec.md).

When a document and the source disagree, source and `AGENTS.md` win. Repair
the document in the same patch. Keep superseded ADRs when they explain why a
legacy path must not be revived.

Omagen is a Quickshell plugin with a QML presentation layer and a bundled Go
backend. Quickshell owns the visible plugin lifecycle; the backend owns the
filesystem, theme, Demo, and recovery operations that must survive UI reloads.

The stable backend ownership and Studio attachment rules are recorded in the
[engine contract](contracts/engine.md). This contract is the boundary for new
Studio capabilities; it does not replace the existing session or recovery
engine.

Live Canvas deliberately has no history/checkpoint engine. Preview state is
session-scoped and replaceable; the session service remains the sole owner of
baseline capture, restore, and interrupted-Apply recovery.

## Theme-bounded bar profiles

Bar styling is represented by the generated `omagen.bar.json` profile. Its
ownership is explicit: `inherit` changes no user layout, `overlay` merges only
theme-owned bar fields, and `theme-owned` may replace the complete bar object
for an opt-in replacement implementation. The backend's bar-profile store
captures the exact user `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json` bytes before a profile
transaction, including unknown fields and the native `bar-off` toggle, and
restores them during Cancel, Restore, theme switching, or crash recovery.

This keeps theme identity separate from persistent machine preference. The
native Quattro bar remains the fallback unless a profile explicitly selects a
replacement plugin.

The Bar Lab also emits `omagen.bar.spec.json`, a versioned `BarSpec v2`
document. Its durable ownership is geometry, topology, behaviour, attention,
and motion; Shell is the authority for shared bar material and shell-level
effects. Legacy surface fields remain readable during this migration but are
not the long-term visual contract. The compiler records whether the spec can
stay on the native Quattro reader or needs Omagen's additive decoration
adapter. Widget placement remains outside this document and stays owned by
Quattro's canonical `shell.json`.

Workspace presentation is an explicit BarSpec field: Default uses Omagen's
faithful clone of Quattro's normal workspace widget, while Numbers, Japanese
Kanji (一–五), Roman numerals, Letters, Dots, and bounded Custom glyphs use that
same Omagen reader.
Hyprland remains the owner of workspace state and click dispatch in every
presentation.

## Shell preset contract

Shell appearance now starts with a deliberately small preset contract:
`default` keeps native Quickshell behavior, while `glass` supplies a
theme-owned translucent alpha baseline plus a scoped Hyprland layer rule for
backdrop blur on the native Quickshell surfaces and Omagen Shell Demo. The
preset is stored separately from `ShellStyle.Overrides`, so changing presets
never destroys an explicit customization.

Advanced Shell controls are reusable on every preset. Their values are written
as explicit `section.key` entries in the generated `shell.toml`; the effective
token list shows whether each value comes from the selected preset, a custom
override, or the native theme fallback. Shell Glass is a compositor-backed
effect: `shell.toml` supplies the translucent surface and generated
`hyprland.lua` supplies the scoped backdrop blur. Cyberpunk Glitch uses the
same compositor boundary for short, event-triggered whole-desktop shader
pulses; it is idle between signals and restores the previous screen-shader and
damage-tracking settings afterward.

Shell owns the visual language shared by shell surfaces, including bar
material and shell-level effects. Bar owns placement, topology, size,
visibility, auto-hide, and widget behavior. Hyprland owns Window and Animations
through the generated `hyprland.lua` artifact. The runtime registry reflects
that split with Quickshell, Quattro, and native Hyprland contract adapters;
these adapters validate and report consumption without replacing native shell,
bar, or compositor ownership.

## Omarchy plugin contract

The root [manifest.json](../../manifest.json) is the package contract:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| ID | <code>pretty.omagen</code> |
| Kinds | <code>overlay</code>, <code>bar-widget</code> |
| Overlay entry point | <code>Omagen.qml</code> |
| Bar-widget entry point | <code>OmagenBarWidget.qml</code> |
| Default bar section | <code>right</code> |
| Keep loaded | <code>true</code> |

Omarchy installs the repository at:

~~~text
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/pretty.omagen/
~~~

The bar widget summons the overlay through the running <code>omarchy-shell</code>;
it does not create a second Quickshell instance.

## Runtime layers

~~~

Advanced generated themes add one opt-in bridge after native theme selection:

~~~text
omarchy theme set
→ native Omarchy applies colors.toml / shell.toml
→ user-owned theme-set.d/omagen-theme-set hook (only after consent)
→ installed Omagen backend observes the advanced marker
~~~

The marker is ignored by native Omarchy, so the fast path remains independent
of Omagen. The bridge is deliberately user-owned and idempotent; it refuses to
replace another theme-set hook and exits safely when the Omagen plugin is no
longer installed.

## Generation pipeline

The production generation path is:

~~~text
image file
→ image decoding and pixel sampling
→ representative colors
→ source palette
→ optional harmony transformation
→ Source / Calm / Mute / Deep / Vibrant / Balanced
→ semantic contrast enforcement
→ Omarchy theme candidate
~~~

The preview path uses the same palette and contrast transformations as the
generation path. This keeps the gallery aligned with the colors that will be
written into <code>colors.toml</code>.

## QML/backend boundary

QML owns:

- Overlay routing and visible state.
- Image selection and settings controls.
- Window, Shell, and Bar composition choices and their visual previews.
- Palette-card selection and keyboard navigation.
- Demo, preview, Apply, Cancel, and recovery requests.
- User-facing busy and error states.

The Go backend owns:

- Image analysis and palette generation.
- Contrast enforcement and theme-file writing.
- Hyprland window overrides and Quattro shell section overrides.
- Durable session records and mutation locking.
- Temporary preview theme aliases.
- Demo capability resolution, window ownership, placement, and cleanup.
- Apply staging, commit, and recovery.
- Restoration and verification of the original theme/background.

The backend remains authoritative when the shell reloads or the overlay is
hidden. A QML close action therefore requests cancel or recovery when needed;
it does not merely discard the visible surface.

## Session lifecycle

~~~mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Active: begin session
    Active --> Previewing: Test live
    Previewing --> Active: choose another direction
    Active --> DemoOpen: open Demo
    DemoOpen --> Active: Dispatch
    Active --> Idle: Cancel and restore
    Active --> Applying: Save & Apply
    Applying --> Idle: commit and clear session
    Active --> Recovery: shell or process interruption
    Applying --> Recovery: interrupted Apply
    Recovery --> Active: Resume
    Recovery --> Idle: Restore and close
~~~

Every active session records the original theme and background before any
temporary theme is applied. Demo and preview artifacts are associated with the
session so cleanup can distinguish them from unrelated user files.

## Apply transaction

Apply follows a staged transaction:

~~~text
persist PREPARED
→ publish an Omagen-owned destination
→ apply the Omarchy theme
→ persist COMMITTED
→ remove the ownership marker
→ clear the active session
~~~

Recovery inspects the current theme and the Omagen ownership marker before
deciding whether a prepared destination can be committed or must be removed.
Restoration is verified against both the original theme and original
background before the session is cleared.

## Omarchy ownership boundaries

Omagen integrates with Omarchy without replacing the native shell systems:

- The plugin is loaded by the long-running <code>omarchy-shell</code> process.
- Theme changes go through Omarchy's theme commands.
- Quattro remains responsible for native bar layout, widget ordering,
  transparency, and input.
- Omagen's Docked form is an additive surface beneath those native widgets;
  native transparency hides that decoration unless the user selects Show
  islands.
- Demo uses temporary Hyprland workspace/window state and restores the user's
  original workspace.
- Cleanup removes only resources that Omagen can prove belong to an inactive
  session.
