# Changelog

All notable changes to **Omarchy Flow** will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Reduce cloud transcription latency by sending capped ephemeral audio inline instead of using a three-round-trip File API lifecycle, and use low thinking for speech-only Gemini Flash requests.
- Prevent Gemini and unrelated environment credentials from reaching external helpers by using a strict child-environment allowlist and trusted absolute system executable paths.
- Keep the running pill synchronized with authoritative model changes from settings, service IPC, direct CLI use, and its own selector; pin each recording to its start-time privacy mode and replace Gemini 3.7 Flash with stable Gemini 3.8 Flash.
- Resolve randomized exclusive recording paths before clearing runtime markers, so normal stop/transcribe can consume and then remove the actual captured WAV.
- Accept secure private directories on filesystems such as btrfs that report a link count of one, and perform captured-child cleanup before closing pipe objects so QML model writes complete normally.
- Restore tick-to-transcribe by preserving the recorder after a successful bounded QML start (while still killing detached captured-pipe holders), and make model selections update immediately in their originating view while all running pill and settings views rapidly reconcile to the same persisted model.
- Finalize ffmpeg with `SIGINT` before validating the private WAV, allowing buffered short recordings to write their header and samples before the audio-length check.
- Harden captured helper execution with process-group and pinned descendant `TERM -> bounded grace -> KILL`, reaping and pipe cleanup on timeout, output overflow, and exceptions.
- Make private-file handling descriptor-relative (`O_NOFOLLOW`/`O_NONBLOCK` from held private directory, `fstat` owner/type/nlink checks, strict read ceilings, exclusive `renameat`, bounded log rotation and truncation).
- Replace predictable `recording.wav` reopening with an exclusively created, descriptor-validated inode passed to ffmpeg through `/proc/self/fd`, preserving a seekable finalized WAV without a mutable target race.
- Enforce a hard end-to-end cloud transcription deadline (including credential lookup, upload, generation, and cleanup) in a killable worker process, retry failed upload cleanup within the deadline, cap transcript char/bytes, and suppress `wl-copy`/`wtype` output.
- Route every QML collector producer through a `16 KiB` output-capped gateway with action-specific deadlines, add matching per-job watchdogs and destruction cleanup, bound JSON parsing/cardinality, and use `Text.PlainText` for externally derived strings.
- Rate-limit log writes and rotate logs, scrub additional `LD_*`/`PYTHON*` env vars in `pill_ipc`, and harden `flowctl` audio test capture.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- Expanded the bar menu into a settings hub for dictation behavior, audio
  input, privacy, HUD appearance, diagnostics, and project information.
- Added persistent preferences for toggle completion, clipboard copying,
  audio source, HUD position, and waveform visibility.
- Added editable Hyprland shortcut setup with conflict visibility, managed
  block installation, automatic reload, and rollback on configuration errors.

### Fixed
- Made Reset Flow preferences restore behavior, audio, HUD, and shortcuts even
  when managed shortcuts are installed.
- Added safe managed-shortcut removal so uninstalling Flow does not leave dead
  Hyprland bindings behind.
- Automatically migrated existing Flow-managed shortcut blocks to the current
  Omarchy shell IPC commands without installing shortcuts for new users.
- Made the local selector consistently use Voxtype's `base.en` model, verified
  that the model is installed in diagnostics, and allowed slower local
  transcriptions more time to finish.
- Clarified the supported provider boundary and local/Gemini setup, and removed
  obsolete manual Hyprland INI shortcut instructions from the README.
- Made settings dropdowns close reliably when the open trigger is tapped again.
- Corrected the recording menu's Transcribe action so it no longer presses
  Return, and preserved temporary HUD error/status messages.
- Queued overlapping service actions so quick push-to-talk releases are not
  dropped while recording is starting.
- Queued rapid settings writes, added cloud SDK readiness diagnostics, and
  hardened legacy runtime compatibility against shared `/tmp` interference.
- Created recording files with owner-only permissions before exposing the
  optional legacy hard-link compatibility path.
- Routed managed Hyprland shortcuts through `omarchy-shell` so they target the
  running Omarchy Quickshell instance instead of an absent default config.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed
- Removed the bar widget's duplicate IPC registration and retained the legacy
  short service target from the single background service.
- Routed QML actions through the executable `flowctl` dispatcher with
  per-process busy guards and strict CLI argument validation.
- Hardened XDG/runtime state and recording markers, rejected unsupported model
  IDs, removed orphaned audio, and stopped writing transcript text to logs.
- Updated Gemini 3.5 Transcribe to use the documented Interactions API and
  explicit WAV input, fixing empty responses reported as "No speech detected".
- Reduced the model selector to `whisper-base.en`, `gemini-3.5-transcribe`, and
  `gemini-3.7-flash`.
- Isolated automated tests from live user configuration and expanded coverage
  for process identity, credentials, injection failures, and recorder races.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- **Omarchy Overlay Integration**: Declared `overlay` kind in `manifest.json` pointing to `Pill.qml`.
- **Unified CLI (`flowctl`)**: Full desktop keybinding and scripting tool with `toggle`, `toggle-submit`, `pause`, `cancel`, `status`, and `model` commands.
- **XDG Directory Compliance**: Standardized configuration under `~/.config/omarchy-flow/` and runtime files under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/omarchy-flow/`.
- **Model Expansion**: Added support for Gemini 3.5 Transcribe (dedicated ultra-fast audio transcription) and Gemini 3.7 Flash.
- **Automated Test Suite**: Added `tests/run.sh` and `tests/test_backend.py` covering schema validation, qmllint, backend state, and CLI commands.
- **Dynamic Virtual Environment Discovery**: Automatically locates Python site-packages in active virtual environments without hardcoded user paths.

### Changed
- Refactored `Pill.qml` root to `Item` with `PanelWindow` on `WlrLayer.Overlay`.
- Enhanced `BarWidget.qml` with background state polling and pause indicators.
- Expanded `Service.qml` IPC interface.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- Initial proof-of-concept release with floating HUD pill and Gemini dictation backend.
