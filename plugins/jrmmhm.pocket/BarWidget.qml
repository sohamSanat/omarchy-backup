// It never moves a widget. The members stay exactly where the user put them in

// only flips `visible` on those slots, and a Row does not lay out an invisible
// child. That is the whole mechanism, and it is the reason every Omarchy tool
// keeps telling the truth about a tucked-away widget: `inBar` still finds it,
// `findPanelWidget` still finds it, its settings still live on its own entry.
//
// Membership can be changed by dragging, and that is the one thing the pocket
// writes: its own `members` key, on its own layout entry, through the host's
// own config mutator. The gesture itself belongs to the bar — the pocket only
// reads the drop marker the bar is already drawing. See
// docs/decisions/0001-pocket-writes-its-own-members.md.
//
// The alternative — mounting other widgets' components inside this one — is
// what ianswope.stack does, and it forces the members out of `bar.layout`,
// which is where all four of its defects come from.

  // inline settings change, which the bar patches into the running widgets
  // instead of rebuilding them. See docs/decisions/0002 for what each costs.
