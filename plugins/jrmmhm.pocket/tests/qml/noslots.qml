// The real BarWidget.qml against a bar that is missing two of the symbols it
// reads. This is the case the README makes a promise about — "a renamed one
// makes a feature stop applying rather than misbehave" — and the only one of
// the fifteen host reads that promise was ever false for.
//
// Measured before the guard: a bar publishing all fourteen other symbols but not
// `moduleSlots` produced five TypeErrors per evaluation, at `resolution` and
// `ownSlot` directly and at `memberHovered`, `apply()` and `tooltipText` through
// them, and the tooltip was left unassigned. `slotBeforeSelf` never threw — it
// walks `layoutIds(ownRegion)`, which is empty once `ownSlot` is gone — so this
// file asserts values rather than counting throws.
//
// Two mechanisms, and both are needed. A thrown binding does not fail an
// assertion: it leaves the property at its last value and aborts whatever was
// reading it. So every probe below is wrapped, and tests/qml/run.sh separately
// refuses any run whose output carries a TypeError from this plugin — without
// that, a regression that threw and left a stale but plausible value would pass
// every line here.
//
// Run through tests/qml/run.sh, which builds the import tree this needs.
