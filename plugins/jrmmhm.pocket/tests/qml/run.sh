# that a red run here can never be followed by the node suite's success line.
#
# Skipped rather than failed when Quickshell or an Omarchy shell is not present:
# GitHub's runners have neither, and the CI workflow says so. The same bargain
# the qmlformat job already makes -- what this covers is covered locally or not
# at all, and that is still more than nothing, because nothing is what the node
# suite and qmlformat together can say about this file.
#
# The harness imports qs.Commons and qs.Ui, which only exist inside an installed
# shell, so the import tree is built here rather than checked in: symlinks to the
# shell's own modules, and one to this repository, so the file under test is the
# working tree and never a copy that can drift from it.
