# 10. The publication review changes documentation, not code

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-08-28
- Corrects the `plugins[]` consequences claimed by the README since 0.1.0
- Records three deliberate non-fixes, so that none of them is a silent one

## Context

Before publishing, the plugin was reviewed end to end against the host it runs
on — `Bar.qml`, `shell.qml`, `services/PluginRegistry.qml`, `Ui/WidgetButton.qml`
and `Commons/Color.qml` of the Omarchy package named in
[`media.md`](../media.md) — and against a live three-monitor session at three
different output scales (1.5, 1.667, 2.4).

Everything the review found was either a documentation defect or a behaviour the
owner chose to leave alone. **No QML or JS changed.** That is the decision this
file records, because three of those choices are the kind that read as bugs to
the next person who finds them, and a non-fix that nobody wrote down is
indistinguishable from an oversight.

## What was wrong, and is now corrected in the README

**The central claim about `plugins[]` was false.** The README stated that moving
a widget into the top-level `plugins[]` array makes `omarchy plugin list` and
plugin managers report it as **off**. `PluginRegistry.isEnabled()` resolves
through `findEntryLocation()`, which searches `bar.layout` *and* `plugins[]`, so
such a widget reports **enabled**. Measured on the reporter's own machine:
`omarchy-overview` sits in `plugins[]` and `omarchy plugin list` prints
`enabled`. `ianswope.stack`'s own README documents the same rule and relies on
it deliberately.

The conclusion the paragraph was drawing survives, and is stronger stated
truthfully — the widget is reported enabled while not being on the bar, and that
split is the defect:

- `shell.qml::summon()` passes the enabled check and then asks
  `Bar.qml::findPanelWidget()` for a slot that was never created, so
  `omarchy-shell shell toggle <id>` fails into a log line.
- `setEnabled()` deletes a `plugins[]` entry when switching off and inserts a
  `bar.layout` entry when switching on, so an off/on round trip leaves the
  widget mounted from both places. The README's old "the manager's toggle can
  double-mount it" was right, and this is the path.
- The widget's settings move to the grouping plugin's own file, which
  `updateEntryInline()` and the settings form never look at. Read out of
  `ianswope/omarchy-stack` at its published `0.1.0`: its `Panel.qml` mounts each
  held widget itself and injects `entry.settings` from `~/.config/omarchy/
  stacks.json`, and its README instructs the reader to move the folded widgets
  into `plugins[]` — the same mechanism this file describes, documented by the
  plugin that uses it.

**The two drop colours can be one colour.** `activeColor` picks `Color.accent`
for a member leaving and `bar.urgent` for a widget arriving. `bar.urgent` is
`Color.bar.active`, generated from the theme's red by
`default/themed/shell.toml.tpl`; `Color.accent` is the theme's accent. On
`solace-sunset` both are `#eb5864` — measured off a capture of a real drag, both
gestures lighting the same colour. On the shipped `kanagawa` theme
`accent == foreground`, so the leaving state is indistinguishable from unlit.
The CHANGELOG's "two opposite answers cannot be mistaken for each other" was a
claim about the code that the themes do not honour, and the README now says so.

**A member in `center` fails deterministically, not occasionally.** With
`centerAnchor` set — the shipped default is `omarchy.clock` — `CenterModules`
declares the hidden placeholder `ModuleList` *before* the three drawn ones.
Slots register in creation order and `resolution` breaks at its first match, so
the placeholder is always the one bound. The README said "may bind the
placeholder"; it does, every time.

## The three non-fixes

**A vertical bar keeps its rough edges.** `growthOrigin` returns
`Item.Right`/`Item.Left` unconditionally, while `Bar.qml` lays a vertical
section out as a `Column` — so the members grow sideways instead of along the
run. `textRotation` adds the bar's own 90° before the reveal's, so the mark's
dots start upright and turn flat, the reverse of a horizontal bar. Both are
cosmetic and both are one line away from a fix. The owner's call was to leave
the code alone; the answer is therefore a README section that says exactly what
a side-docked bar looks like, because a documented rough edge is a choice and an
undocumented one is a bug report on day one.

**The tooltip stays a snapshot.** `Ui/WidgetButton.qml` calls `bar.showTooltip`
only from `onEntered`, and `triggerPress()` hides the tooltip before it emits
`pressed` — so `Model.describe()`'s "Pocket open" and "Pinned" lines never
appear on the hover or the click that causes them. They are not dead: the next
`onEntered` reads the new state. Fixing it means calling `bar.showTooltip` again
whenever the text changes, which is a plugin re-driving a host mechanism it does
not own, for two lines that are one pointer movement away from correct. Recorded
instead, in the README's own list of limits.

**`bar.shell.mutateShellConfig` stays.** Omarchy's bar-widget contract test
(`test/shell.d/bar-widget-contract-test.sh`) mocks `updateEntryInline` and not
`mutateShellConfig`, which makes `updateEntryInline` the sanctioned way for a
widget to write its own settings back. It is still the wrong tool here, for two
independent reasons. It rebuilds the entry as `{ id }` plus whatever it is
handed and drops every other key, which breaks 0001's promise that Pocket never
touches anything else on its entry; and it edits entries in place with no way to
express a move, which is exactly what the placement repair does. `Bar.qml`
itself reaches for `mutateShellConfig` in three places for the same purpose.
0001 stands.

## Consequences

**The README grew a "Good to know" section, and shrank.** Three entries sit in
the running text because they change the first hour — a member in `center`, a
widget dragged in beside a collapsed pocket, and `SUPER+CTRL+1…9` — and the rest
fold into four themed `<details>` blocks. Honesty was never the thing to trade
away; the wall was. The README owns how many there are; no other file states a
count, because a count in two places is a count that drifts.

**Two drawings were retired in favour of two recordings.** `pocket-states.svg`
and `pocket-drag.svg` both described things a capture shows better, and both had
drawn the mark's dots the wrong way round since they were made: `U+F01D8` is
`md-dots_horizontal` and `textRotation` adds 90° as the pocket opens, so
collapsed is `•••` and open is `⋮`, and the figures had it inverted. A drawing
of a live surface invents that class of error; a capture cannot.
`pocket-layout.svg` stays, because a configuration file is the one thing here
that cannot be photographed.

**One edge condition came back clean, and is written down for that reason.** A
changed bar size or output scale moves nothing that Pocket decides: there is no
pixel literal anywhere in `BarWidget.qml`, the mark's slot comes from
`Style.bar.iconSlot` like every other bar icon's, and the mark was seen
rendering identically on outputs at scales 1.5, 1.667 and 2.4. A check that
found nothing is indistinguishable from a check that was never made unless its
result is recorded, so the README states it.

**The recordings are perishable and say so.** `docs/media.md` records the
output, scale, theme, bar size, font, region and encoder settings they were made
with, because none of it is recoverable from the files afterwards.

**One thing the review could not automate.** A drag driven by a virtual `uinput`
button plus compositor cursor warps starts a real bar drag and completes a real
drop, but the grab does not survive the pointer coming to rest — so it records
the cancelled drag this plugin documents rather than the drop it was aiming for.
Across 111 frames of such a take the mark never lit once; in the human take that
ships it lights for 2.0 s going in and 2.1 s coming out. The drag recording in
the README is therefore a human gesture, and `shell.json` was byte-identical
before and after it — which is also the cheapest end-to-end proof that both
gestures are each other's inverse.

**The shipped take is the second one.** The first spoiled itself in a way worth
keeping: the pointer stayed on the mark after the drop, the section narrowed
because the dropped widget had just been hidden, and the tray chevron slid
underneath the resting pointer and unfolded its drawer into frame. That is not a
defect, it is the reflow the README describes for a widget dropped beside a
collapsed pocket, arriving from the pointer's side instead of the widget's.
`media.md` carries it as a shooting note.
