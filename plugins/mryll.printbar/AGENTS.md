# AGENTS.md — printbar

Generic Waybar printer widget. One-shot Rust binary: collect (IPP + SNMP) → merge → print Waybar JSON, exit 0.

- MUST exit 0 with valid Waybar JSON (`{"text","tooltip","class":[..],"alt"}`) on EVERY path, including errors (see `error_output`).
- Blocking only — no async runtime. Sources run on std threads with `recv_timeout`.
- Tooltip uses Pango markup (not HTML), framed/themed like meteobar/tickerbar. Escape every string that came off the wire — on the bar and the error paths too, not just the tooltip.
- Theme chain (`theme.rs::load_from`): Omarchy `$XDG_STATE_HOME/omarchy/current/theme/colors.toml` (legacy `~/.config/omarchy/...` as fallback) → pywal `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/wal/colors.json` → built-in One Dark. An empty XDG var means unset. Every field degrades on its own, and values are validated DURING selection so an invalid semantic key falls through to its legacy alias.
- `palette.rs` owns every color printbar itself defines (severity from the theme, ink per colorant) and the supply ramp's stops. `supply_state` classifies against `supply_stops`, and `--json` publishes both, so the QML panel never keeps a second copy. The panel's own chrome still uses the shell's live `Color` tokens — deliberate, see the header comment in `omarchy/Panel.qml`.
- Theme tests must never read the real environment: go through `load_from`/`dir_from`/`candidate_paths`, and pin `HOME` + the XDG dirs in `tests/cli.rs`.
- Build: `make build`; install: `make install PREFIX=~/.local`. Lint: `cargo clippy`; format `cargo fmt`.
- **A tooltip meter is PARKED, not rendered in place.** `build_tooltip` pushes a `METER<i>` sentinel row plus a `MeterRow` into `meters`, and the width pass resolves them. The bar has to reach the tooltip's right edge, and that edge is the widest TEXT row — which does not exist yet while the supplies are being built. The width pass MUST skip `SEP` and `METER` rows, or the measurement is circular. Every meter in one tooltip gets the SAME bar length: they stack, so a reader compares them against each other.
- **`screenshots/demo/demo-data` RE-IMPLEMENTS the tooltip renderer in bash.** The README screenshots are made from it, so a change to `build_tooltip`'s geometry has to be mirrored there in the same commit, or the published screenshots stop showing the product.
- **The CLI always runs through `/bin/sh -c 'exec "$0" "$@"'`, never direct.** A nonexistent binary handed to Quickshell 0.3.1 can abort the whole shell inside the failed start (claudebar#6), before any QML signal fires. The failed-start discriminator is `!sawExit || exitCode === 126 || exitCode === 127` on empty output; any other exited-empty run is an operational failure, never "not installed".
- **`installCmd` is the one constant** — the message shows it and the button copies it (`Util.execArgv(["wl-copy", ...])`, no shell line, no trailing newline). The button gates on `notInstalled`, never on error text. Pinned in `tests/plugin_qml.rs`.
