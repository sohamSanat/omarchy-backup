# Moodpeak [V2]
re-work of Moodpeak [base-branch](https://github.com/HANCORE-linux/omarchy-moodpeak-theme/tree/moodpeak-v1) 

I have added specific window rules to **disable opacity and dimming effects** for all  applications.

**The Goal:** I wanted to create a solid visual experience with a total focus on the terminal colors.

<b>**Customization:** If you prefer transparency or dimming, simply remove the **windowrule**:</b>
- `windowrule = match:class .*, opacity 1.0 override 1.0 override, no_dim on`
- section in:
`~/.config/omarchy/themes/moodpeak/hyprland.conf
`
- after editing , save. Than reload Theme:  go Omarchy Menu > Style > Theme > select Moodpeak.
